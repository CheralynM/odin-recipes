        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take out a medium sized bowl and add in the garlic, sesame oil, 
                ketchup, hoisin, water, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and 
                sriracha. Next, lightly mix everything until even and smooth.</li>
            <li>If you decide to use rice instead of brioche rolls, rinse your 
                rice and prepare it according to the instructions on the bag or 
                on your rice cooker. Complete the following steps while the rice 
                is cooking.</li>
            <li>Take out a large skillet and add the beef. Next, turn the heat to 
                medium and break up the beef into chunks about the size of 
                a grape.</li>
            <li>Cook the beef until it is well browned (5-6 minutes). Then 
                add in the mix of ingredients from step 1. Next, stir everything 
                together well until the sauce starts to evaporate and the mixture 
                becomes "sloppy" (5-6 minutes)</li>

                        the buns. Finally, top the beef mixture with green onions

                    </li>

                        cup of the beef mixture. Finally, top the beef mixture 
                        with green onions and sesame seeds. </li>
