In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

The main goal of this project is to build up my HTML skills.
I will revisit it in the future to style it up with CSS.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated that I can create, link, and display the basic text and images necessary for creating a website.
